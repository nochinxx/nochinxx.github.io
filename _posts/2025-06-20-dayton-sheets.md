## Overview

We built a multi-tenant RFQ and quoting platform featuring buyer/seller dashboards, role-based access, spreadsheet UI, seller magic links, batch updates, and buyer aggregation views.  

This replaced a messy workflow in Google Sheets and saved thousands in operational costs.

      We converted their laborious process from entering seller data in a buyer sheet into a streamlined full-stack web app.

      The vision was to have a master sheet with products where sellers could enter quotes and updates would sync in real-time. Private sheets, master sheet aggregation, and live dashboards made it all possible.
