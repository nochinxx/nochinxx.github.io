title: "Building Dayton Sheets — RFQ Tool"
date: 2025-06-20
---

We built a multi-tenant RFQ and quoting platform featuring buyer/seller dashboards, 
role-based access, spreadsheet UI, seller magic links, batch updates, and buyer aggregation views.  

This replaced a messy workflow in Google Sheets and saved thousands in operational costs.

## The Vision

We converted Dayton’s manual workflow — where sellers filled in individual buyer sheets — 
into a streamlined full-stack web app.  

The system enables:
- Private seller portals with magic-link login
- A master buyer sheet where updates propagate to seller sheets
- Real-time aggregation of seller quotes into buyer dashboards
- Batch updates and secure role-based access  

This setup allowed all parties to collaborate without juggling dozens of disconnected spreadsheets.

- Saved Dayton **thousands in operational costs**
